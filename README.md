# Digital Image Processing [Lecture]
Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image, in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it. It is a type of signal processing in which input is an image and output may be image or characteristics/features associated with that image.

This notebook discusses a few fundamental definitions, such as digital image, colour spaces and basic techniques of digital image processing. In the later sections, some advanced computer vision algorithms are outlined for your reference.
